    <p><i><h3>An aquatic ecosystem is an ecosystem found in and around a body of water, in contrast to land-based terrestrial ecosystems.
         Aquatic ecosystems contain communities of organisms—aquatic life—that are dependent on each other and on their environment.
        The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are marine ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems.[1] Freshwater ecosystems may be lentic 
        (slow moving water, including pools, ponds, and lakes); lotic (faster moving water, for example streams and rivers); and wetlands (areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time).</h3></i></p>

 <pre> <h2>Marine Coastal Ecosystem: </h2> </pre>
 <p>A marine coastal ecosystem is a marine ecosystem which occurs where the land meets the ocean. Marine coastal ecosystems include many very different types of marine habitats, each with their own characteristics and species composition.
  They are characterized by high levels of biodiversity and productivity.For example, estuaries are areas where freshwater rivers meet the saltwater of the ocean, creating an environment that is home to a wide variety of species, including fish, shellfish, and birds. Salt marshes are coastal wetlands which thrive on low-energy shorelines in temperate and high-latitude areas, populated with salt-tolerant plants such as cordgrass 
 and marsh elder that provide important nursery areas for many species of fish and shellfish. Mangrove forests survive in the intertidal zones of tropical or subtropical coasts, populated by salt-tolerant trees that protect habitat for many marine species, including crabs, shrimp, and fish.

 <pre> <h2> Marine Surface Ecosystem: </h2></pre>
<p>Organisms that live freely at the ocean surface, termed neuston, include keystone organisms like the golden seaweed Sargassum that makes up the Sargasso Sea, floating barnacles, marine snails, nudibranchs, and cnidarians. Many ecologically and economically important fish species live as or rely upon neuston. Species at the surface are not distributed uniformly;
     the ocean's surface harbours unique neustonic communities and ecoregions found at only certain latitudes and only in specific ocean basins. 
    But the surface is also on the front line of climate change and pollution. Life on the ocean's surface connects worlds. From shallow waters to the deep sea, the open ocean to rivers and lakes, numerous terrestrial and marine species depend on the surface ecosystem and the organisms found there.[1]

    The ocean's surface acts like a skin between the atmosphere above and the water below, and harbours an ecosystem unique to this environment. This sun-drenched habitat can be defined as roughly one metre in depth, as nearly half of UV-B is attenuated within this first meter.[2] Organisms here must contend with wave action and unique chemical [3][4][5] and physical properties
    .[6] The surface is utilised by a wide range of species, from various fish and cetaceans, to species that ride on ocean debris (termed rafters).

<pre><h2>Lentic Ecosystem: </h2></pre>
<p>
    It includes all non-flowing (still waters) such as ponds, swamps, bogs, lagoons, lakes, and so on. It also includes wetlands (areas of land that get covered with water periodically). Lentic systems usually do not have a source, as they form in places where the groundwater reaches the earth’s surface. Sometimes, water will stay on the earth’s surface due to the saturation of the underlying land. Some lakes and ponds are created by humans for commercial and recreational use.

Animals and plants in a lentic system behave and adapt differently because there are various zones of every lentic system with different abiotic conditions.

The diagram below illustrates the zones of a lentic system.

<pre><h2> Lotic Ecosystem: </h2></pre>
<p>
    The term lotic comes from Latin lotus meaning washing. It is a running water bodies such as streams and rivers. Lotic or flowing ecosystem is river channels and other related aquatic environments creek, brook, spring, or stream. They vary in size and shape.
     It includes small waterfalls to various big sized river water bodies. This ecosystem contains two main zones such as pools and rapids. In this case, the pools are the deeper water bodies where the currents are slower while the rapids are the areas where the water is fast with 
     clear bottom. Moreover, in this ecosystem there is a difference between abiotic and biotic factors.</p><style>

<pre><h2>Wetlands:</h2></pre>

 <p>Wetlands, or simply a wetland, is a distinct ecosystem that is flooded or saturated by water, either permanently (for years or decades) or seasonally (for weeks or months). Flooding results in oxygen-free (anoxic) processes prevailing, especially in the soils.[1] 
        The primary factor that distinguishes wetlands from terrestrial land forms or water bodies is the characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the unique anoxic hydric soils.[2] Wetlands are considered among the most biologically diverse of all ecosystems,
         serving as home to a wide range of plant and animal species. Methods for assessing wetland functions, wetland ecological health, and general wetland condition have been developed for many regions of the world. These methods have contributed to wetland conservation partly by raising public awareness of the functions some wetlands provide.[3] Constructed wetlands are designed and built to treat municipal and industrial wastewater as well as to divert stormwater runoff. Constructed wetlands may also play a role in water-sensitive
